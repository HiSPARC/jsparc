Welcome to jSparc's documentation!
==================================

This documentation describes |jsparc|, a JavaScript library for web
applications. Also included are the manuals for the various web
applications that have been made with the library.

The |jsparc| library makes it easy to access the |hisparc| Public
Database API, download cosmic-ray and weather data, interpolate between
different datasets, create histograms, and much more!

Several web applications are based on this library, here are some guides
to using those.

The source code can be found on `GitHub
