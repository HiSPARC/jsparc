Station distances
=================

This page describes the web application `Station distances
<https://data.hisparc.nl/media/jsparc/station_distances.html>`_. With this
simple web application you can easily determine the distances between any two
|hisparc| stations.


Distance calculation
--------------------

The shown distances is the great-cricle distance between the stations.
Which means that it accounts for the curvature of the Earth. More information
about this and the equations used to calculate the distance can be found on
this page: `Great-circle distance between two points
<https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html>`_.


Units
-----

In addition to showing the distance in meters, the time it would take light
to travel this distance is also shown. This can be useful when dealing with
the relativistic particles which occur in cosmic-ray induced air showers.
